* SUBJECT TO CHANGE FOR CAPSTONE* 

App concept:
Allow users to communicate anonymously throughout the world. This app could be useful to anyone trying to understand more about the world around them. Obviously there are some issues that could be brought about with this app, but hopefully I can help everyone maintain a positive user experience while still preserving anonymity and fun.

Thinking about possible user account integration as well as a quick switch for anonymous mode. Ranking system might be added. As well as search and query. Maybe with favorites too.

The topics really have no set agenda. Anyone can talk about whatever they want and there are few limiting factors. I really want to see how people communicate though the internet without restrictions. Should be a fun project.
